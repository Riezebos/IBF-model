# Drought trigger model development

Structured in three consecutive steps:
1. [impact-data](./impact-data/)

   analyse, filter and aggregate impact data of droughts
2. [skill-assessment](./skill-assessment/)

   evaluate if and which meterological data (NDVI, SPEI, etc.) is of sufficient quality to be included in the trigger model
   
3. [trigger-model](./trigger-model/)
   
   generate a `trigger script` based on chosen input metereological data
