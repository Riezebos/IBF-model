    Perform zonal statistics on raster data ('.tif') , based on polygons defined in shape file ('.shp')
    
    INPUT:
    - rasterfile: path to TIFF file 
    - shapefile : path to .shp file 
    - aggregate_by: A Python function that returns a single numnber. Will use this to aggregate values per polygon.
    NOTE: Can also provide a list of functions if multiple metrics are disired.
    - minval / maxval : Physical boundaries of quantity encoded in TIFF file. Values outside this range are usually reserved to denote special terrain/areas in image
    - nameKey / pcodeKey : column names in shape file that contain unique identifiers for every polygon 
    - polygonKey : by default geopandas uses the 'geometry' column to store the polygons
