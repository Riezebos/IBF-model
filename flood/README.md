# Flood trigger model development

Structured in three consecutive steps:
1. impact-data

   analyse, filter and aggregate impact data of the specific disaster type
2. skill-assessment

   evaluate if and which meterological data (river discharge, rainfall, etc.) is of sufficient quality to be included in the trigger model
   
3. trigger-model
   
   generate a `trigger script` based on chosen input metereological data
